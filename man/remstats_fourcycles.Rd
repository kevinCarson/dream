The function computes the four-cycles network sufficient statistic for a two-mode relational
sequence with the exponential weighting function (Lerner and Lomi 2020). In essence, the
four-cycles measure captures the tendency for clustering to occur in the network of past
events, whereby an event is more likely to occur between a sender node \emph{a} and receiver
node \emph{b} given that \emph{a} has interacted with other receivers in past events who have
received events from other senders that interacted with \emph{b} (e.g., Duxbury and Haynie 2021, Lerner and Lomi 2020). The function
also allows users to use two different weighting functions, return the counts of past events, reduce
computational runtime, and specify a dyadic cutoff for relational relevancy.

\details{
The function calculates the four-cycles network statistic for two-mode relational event models
based on the exponential weighting function used in either Lerner and Lomi
(2020) or Lerner et al. (2013).

Following Lerner and Lomi (2020), the exponential weighting function in
relational event models is:
\deqn{w(s, r, t) = e^{-(t-t') \cdot \frac{ln(2)}{T_{1/2}} }}

Following Lerner et al. (2013), the exponential weighting function in
relational event models is:
\deqn{w(s, r, t) = e^{-(t-t') \cdot \frac{ln(2)}{T_{1/2}} } \cdot \frac{ln(2)}{T_{1/2}}}

In both of the above equations, \emph{s} is the current event sender, \emph{r} is the
current event receiver (target), \emph{t} is the current event time, \emph{t'} is the
past event times that meet the weight subset (in this case, all events that
have the same sender and receiver), and \eqn{T_{1/2}} is the halflife parameter.

The formula for four-cycles for event \eqn{e_i} is:
\deqn{four cycles_{e_{i}} = \sqrt[3]{\sum_{s' and r'} w(s', r, t) \cdot w(s, r', t) \cdot w(s', r', t)}}

That is, the four-cycle measure captures all the past event structures in which the
current event pair, sender \emph{s} and target \emph{r} close a four-cycle. In particular, it
finds all events in which: a past sender \emph{s'} had a relational event with
target \emph{r}, a past target \emph{r'} had a relational event with current sender \emph{s}, and finally,
a relational event occurred between sender \emph{s'} and target \emph{r'}.

Four-cycles are computationally expensive, especially for large relational event
sequences (see Lerner and Lomi 2020 for a discussion on this), therefore this
function allows the user to input previously computed target indegree and sender
outdegree scores to reduce the runtime. Relational events where
either the event target or event sender were not involved in any prior relational
events (i.e., a target indegree or sender outdegree score of 0) will close no-four
cycles. This function exploits this feature.

Moreover, researchers interested in modeling temporal relevancy (see Quintane,
Mood, Dunn, and Falzone 2022; Lerner and Lomi 2020) can specify the dyadic
weight cutoff, that is, the minimum value for which the weight is considered
relationally relevant. Users who do not know the specific dyadic cutoff value to use, can use the
\code{\link{remstats_dyadcut}} function.

Following Lerner and Lomi (2020), if the counts of the past events are requested, the formula for four-cycles formation for
event \eqn{e_i} is:
\deqn{four cycles_{e_{i}} = \sum_{i=1}^{|S'|} \sum_{j=1}^{|R'|} \min\left[d(s'_{i}, r, t),\ d(s, r'_{j}, t),\ d(s'_{i}, r'_{j}, t)\right]}
where, \eqn{d()} is the number of past events that meet the specific set operations, \eqn{d(s'_{i},r,t)} is the number
of past events where the current event receiver received a tie from another sender \eqn{s'_{i}}, \eqn{d(s,r'_{j},t)} is the number
of past events where the current event sender sent a tie to another receiver \eqn{r'_{j}}, and \eqn{d(s'_{i},r'_{j},t)} is the
number of past events where the sender \eqn{s'_{i}} sent a tie to the receiver \eqn{r'_{j}}. Moreover, the counting
equation can leverage relational relevancy, by specifying the halflife parameter, exponential
weighting function, and the dyadic cut off weight values (see the above sections for help with this). If the user is not interested in modeling
relational relevancy, then those value should be left at their default values.
