The function computes the set of one-mode triadic formation statistics discussed in Butts (2008) for a one-mode relational
event sequence (see also Lerner and Lomi 2020). The function can compute the following triadic formations: 1) incoming shared partners (ISP),
2) outgoing shared partners (OSP), 3) incoming two-paths (ITP), and 4) outgoing two-paths (OTP). Importantly, this function allows for the triadic formation
statistics to be computed only for the sampled events, while creating the weights based on the full event sequence (see
Lerner and Lomi 2020; Vu et al. 2015). The function also allows users to use two different
weighting functions, return the counts of past events, reduce computational
runtime, and specify a dyadic cutoff for relational relevancy.

\details{
The function calculates the triadic formation statistics discussed in Butts (2008) for relational
event sequences based on the exponential weighting function used in either Lerner
and Lomi (2020) or Lerner et al. (2013).

Following Lerner and Lomi (2020), the exponential weighting function in
relational event models is:
\deqn{w(s, r, t) = e^{-(t-t') \cdot \frac{ln(2)}{T_{1/2}} }}

Following Lerner et al. (2013), the exponential weighting function in
relational event models is:
\deqn{w(s, r, t) = e^{-(t-t') \cdot \frac{ln(2)}{T_{1/2}} } \cdot \frac{ln(2)}{T_{1/2}}}

In both of the above equations, \emph{s} is the current event sender, \emph{r} is the
current event receiver (target), \emph{t} is the current event time, \emph{t'} is the
past event times that meet the weight subset, and \eqn{T_{1/2}} is the halflife parameter.

\strong{Outgoing Shared Partners}:

The general formula for outgoing shared partners for event \eqn{e_i} is:
\deqn{OSP_{e_{i}} = \sqrt{ \sum_h w(s, h, t) \cdot w(r, h, t) }}

That is, as discussed in Butts (2008), outgoing shared partners finds all
past events where the current sender and target sent a relational tie (i.e.,
were a sender in a relational event) to the same \emph{h} node.

Following Butts (2008), if the counts of the past events are requested, the formula for outgoing shared partners for
event \eqn{e_i} is:
\deqn{OSP{e_{i}} = \sum_{i=1}^{|H|} \min\left[d(s,h,t), d(s,h,t)\right]}
Where, \eqn{d()} is the number of past events that meet the specific set operations. \eqn{d(s,h,t)} is the number
of past events where the current event sender sent a tie to a third actor, \emph{h}, and \eqn{d(r,h,t)} is the number
of past events where the current event receiver sent a tie to a third actor, \emph{h}. The sum loops through all
unique actors that have formed past outgoing shared partners structures with the current event sender and receiver.
Moreover, the counting equation can be used in tandem with relational relevancy, by specifying the halflife parameter, exponential
weighting function, and the dyadic cut off weight values. If the user is not interested in modeling
relational relevancy, then those value should be left at their defaults.

\strong{Outgoing Two-Paths}:

The general formula for outgoing two-paths for event \eqn{e_i} is:
\deqn{OTP_{e_{i}} = \sqrt{ \sum_h w(s, h, t) \cdot w(h, r, t) }}

That is, as discussed in Butts (2008), outgoing two-paths finds all
past events where the current sender sends a relational tie to node \emph{h} and
the current target receives a relational tie from the same \emph{h} node.

Following Butts (2008), if the counts of the past events are requested, the formula for outgoing two paths for
event \eqn{e_i} is:
\deqn{OTP_{e_{i}} = \sum_{i=1}^{|H|} \min\left[d(s,h,t), d(h,r,t)\right]}
Where, \eqn{d()} is the number of past events that meet the specific set operations. \eqn{d(s,h,t)} is the number
of past events where the current event sender sent a tie to a third actor, \emph{h}, and \eqn{d(h,r,t)} is the number
of past events where the third actor \emph{h} sent a tie to the current event receiver. The sum loops through all
unique actors that have formed past outgoing two-path structures with the current event sender and receiver.

\strong{Incoming Two-Paths}:

The general formula for incoming two-paths for event \eqn{e_i} is:
\deqn{ITP_{e_{i}} = \sqrt{ \sum_h w(r, h, t) \cdot w(h, s, t) }}

That is, as discussed in Butts (2008), incoming two-paths finds all past events
where the current sender was the receiver in a relational event where the sender
was a node h and the current target was the sender in a past relational event
where the target was the same node h.

Following Butts (2008), if the counts of the past events are requested, the formula for incoming two paths for
event \eqn{e_i} is:
\deqn{ITP_{e_{i}} = \sum_{i=1}^{|H|} \min\left[d(r,h,t), d(h,s,t\right]}
Where, \eqn{d()} is the number of past events that meet the specific set operations. \eqn{d(r,h,t)} is the number
of past events where the current event receiver sent a tie to a third actor, \emph{h}, and \eqn{d(h,s,t} is the number
of past events where the third actor \emph{h} sent a tie to the current event sender. The sum loops through all
unique actors that have formed past incoming two-path structures with the current event sender and receiver.

\strong{Incoming Shared Partners}:

The general formula for incoming shared partners for event \eqn{e_i} is:
\deqn{ISP_{e_{i}} = \sqrt{ \sum_h w(h, s, t) \cdot w(h, r, t) }}

That is, as discussed in Butts (2008), incoming shared partners finds all
past events where the current sender and target were themselves the target
in a relational event from the same \emph{h} node.

Following Butts (2008), if the counts of the past events are requested, the formula for incoming shared partners for
event \eqn{e_i} is:
\deqn{ISP_{e_{i}} = \sum_{i=1}^{|H|} \min\left[d(h,s,t), d(h,r,t)\right]}
Where, \eqn{d()} is the number of past events that meet the specific set operations, \eqn{d(h,s,t)} is the number
of past events where the current event sender received a tie from a third actor, \emph{h}, and \eqn{d(h,r,t)} is the number
of past events where the current event receiver received a tie from a third actor, \emph{h}. The sum loops through all
unique actors that have formed past incoming shared partners structures with the current event sender and receiver.

Lastly, researchers interested in modeling temporal relevancy (see Quintane,
Mood, Dunn, and Falzone 2022; Lerner and Lomi 2020) can specify the dyadic
weight cutoff, that is, the minimum value for which the weight is considered
relationally relevant. Users who do not know the specific dyadic cutoff value to use, can use the
\code{\link{remstats_dyadcut}} function.
