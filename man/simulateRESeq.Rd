\code{simulateRESeq()} has been deprecated starting on version 1.0.0 of the \code{dream} package. Instead, please use the \code{simulate_rem_seq()} function and see the \code{NEWS.md} file for more details.

The function allows users to simulate a random one-mode relational event sequence
between \emph{n} actors for \emph{k} events. Importantly, this function follows the methods
discussed in Butts (2008), Amati, Lomi, and Snijders (2024), and Scheter and
Quintane (2021). See the details for more information on this algorithm. Critically,
this function can be used to simulate a random event sequence, to assess the goodness of
fit for ordinal timing relational event models (see Amati, Lomi, and Snijders 2024), and simulate
random outcomes for relational outcome models.
}
\details{
Following the authors listed in the descriptions section, the probability of
selecting a new event for \emph{t+1} based on the past relational history, \emph{\eqn{H_{t}}},  from \emph{\eqn{0<t<t+1}}
is given by:

\deqn{ p(e_{t}) = \frac{\lambda{ij}(t;\theta)}{\sum_{(u,v)\in R_{t}} \lambda_{uv}(t;\theta)} }

where \emph{(i,j,t)} is the triplet that corresponds to the dyadic pair with sender \emph{i}
and target \emph{j} at time \emph{t} contained in the full risk set, \emph{\eqn{R_{t}}}, based on the
past relational history. \eqn{\lambda_{ij}(t;\theta)} is formulated as:

\deqn{ \lambda_{ij}(t;\theta) = e^{\sum_{p}\theta_{p} X_{ijp}(H_{t})} }

where \eqn{\theta_{p}} corresponds to the specific parameter weight given by the
user, and  \eqn{X_{ijp}} represents the value of the specific statistic based on the
current past relational history \emph{\eqn{H_{t}}}.

Following Scheter and Quintane (2021) and Amati, Lomi, and Snijders (2024), the
algorithm for simulating the random relational sequence for \emph{k} events is:
\itemize{
\item 1. Initialize the full risk set, \emph{\eqn{R_{t}}}, which is the full Cartesian plot of actors.
\item 2. Randomly sample the first event \eqn{ e_{1} } and add that event into the relational history, \emph{\eqn{H_{t}}}.
\item 3. Until \emph{i} = \emph{k}, compute the sufficient statistics for each event in the risk set,
sample a new event \eqn{ e_{i} } based on the probability function specified above, and add that element into the relational history.
\item 4. End when \emph{i} > \emph{k}.
}

Currently, the function supports 6 statistics for one-mode networks. These are:
\itemize{
\item Inertia: \eqn{{n}_{ijt}}
\item Reciprocity: \eqn{{n}_{jit}}
\item Target Indegree: \eqn{\sum_{k} {n}_{kjt}}
\item Target Outdegree: \eqn{\sum_{k} {n}_{jkt}}
\item Sender Outdegree: \eqn{\sum_{k} {n}_{ikt}}
\item Sender Indegree: \eqn{\sum_{k} {n}_{kit}}
\item Assortativity: \eqn{\sum_{k} {n}_{kit} \cdot \sum_{k} {n}_{ikt}}
\item Transitive Triplets: \eqn{\sum_{k} {n}_{ikt} \cdot {n}_{kjt}}
\item Three Cycles: \eqn{\sum_{k} {n}_{jkt} \cdot {n}_{kit}}
}
Where \emph{n} represents the counts of past events, \emph{i} is the event sender, and \emph{j} is the event target. See Scheter and Quintane (2021)
and Butts (2008) for a further discussion of these statistics.

Users are allowed to insert a starting event sequence to base the simulation on. A few things are worth nothing. The starting
event sequence should be a matrix with \emph{n} rows indicating the number of starting events and 2 columns, with the
first representing the event senders and the second column representing the event targets. Internally, the number
of actors is ignored, as the number of possible actors in the risk set is based only on the actors present in the
starting event sequence. Finally, the sender and target actor IDs should be numerical values.
