\code{computeHomFourCycles()} has been deprecated starting on version 1.0.0 of the \code{dream} package. Please use the \code{netstats_tm_homfourcycles()} function and see the \code{NEWS.md} file for more details.

This function computes the number of homophilous four-cycles in
a two-mode network as proposed by Fujimoto, Snijders, and Valente (2018: 380).
See Fujimoto, Snijders, and Valente (2018) for more details about this
measure.
}
\details{
Following Fujimoto, Snijders, and Valente (2018: 380), the number
of homophilous four-cycles for actor \emph{i} is:
\deqn{ \sum_{j} \sum_{a\neq b} y_{ia}y_{ib}y_{ja}y_{jb}I{{v_{i} = v_{j}}}}
where \emph{y} is the two-mode adjacency matrix, \emph{v} is the vector of
membership scores (e.g., sports/club membership), \emph{a} and \emph{b} represent
the level two groups, and \eqn{I{v_i = v_j}} is the indicator function that
is 1 if the values are the same and 0 if not.
}
\examples{

# For this example, we use the Davis Southern Women's Dataset.
data("southern.women")
#creating a random binary membership vector
set.seed(9999)
membership <- sample(0:1, nrow(southern.women), replace = TRUE)
#the homophilous four-cycle values
computeHomFourCycles(southern.women, mem = membership)
