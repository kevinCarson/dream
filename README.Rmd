The dream package provides users with helpful functions for relational event modeling/analysis. In particular, dream provides users with helper functions for large relational event analysis, such as recently proposed sampling procedures for creating relational risk sets. Alongside the set of functions for relational event analysis, this package includes functions for the structural analysis of one- and two-mode networks, such as network constraint and effective size measures. 

This package was developed with support from the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Human Networks and Data Science Program (HNDS) under award number 2241536 (PI: Diego F. Leal). Any opinions, findings, and conclusions, or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the NSF.

## Installation

You can install the stable verison of `dream` from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dream) via:  
``` r
install.packages("dream")
```

You can install the development version of dream from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("kevinCarson/dream")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(dream)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
