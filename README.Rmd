The `dream` package provides users with helpful functions for (large) relational event modeling/analysis. For an introduction to relational events analysis/modeling, see [Butts (2008)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9531.2008.00203.x), [Butts et al. (2023)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/network-science/article/relational-event-models-in-network-science/D3C9C3D18FC9C3FCC8561CCC4FEE747A), [Duxbury (2023)](https://methods.sagepub.com/book/mono/longitudinal-network-models/toc#_), and [Bianchi et al. (2024)](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-statistics-040722-060248). In particular, `dream` provides users with helper functions for large relational event analysis, such as recently proposed sampling procedures for creating relational risk sets (i.e., sampling from the observed event sequence [(Lerner and Lomi 2020)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/network-science/article/reliability-of-relational-event-model-estimates-under-sampling-how-to-fit-a-relational-event-model-to-360-million-dyadic-events/B4286F370CD3A1A4ED30DF5120F04897), case-control sampling [(Vu et al. 2015)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378873315000477)). Alongside the set of functions for relational event analysis, this package includes functions for the structural analysis of one- and two-mode networks, such as network constraint and effective size measures.

## Installation

You can install the stable verison of `dream` from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dream) via:  
``` r
install.packages("dream")
```

You can install the development version of `dream` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("kevinCarson/dream")
```

## The `dream` Package API

The dream package 'API' is structured into six categories, where the prefix identifies what category the specific function corresponds to (see below): 

- `remstats_`
- `netstats_om_`
- `netstats_tm_`
- `estimate_`
- `simulate_`
- `create_` 

The `remstats_` functions compute relational/network statistics for relational event sequences. For instance, `remstats_fourcycles` computes the four-cycles network statistic for a two-mode relational event sequence. The `create_` function creates a risk-set for one- and two-mode relational event sequences based on a set of sampling procedures. The `netstats_om_` series of functions compute static network statics for one-mode networks (i.e., `netstats_om_pib` computes [Leal (2025)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00491241251322517) measure for potential for intercultural brokerage). The `netstats_tm_` set of functions compute static network statistics for two-mode networks (i.e., `netstats_tm_effective` computes [Burchard and Cornwell (2018)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378873317302241) measure for two-mode ego effective size). The `estimate_` function estimates a relational event models for relational event sequences. Currently, the only function in this set is `estimate_rem_logit`, which estimates the ordinal timing relational event model and, under certain conditions, can estimate a Cox-proportional hazard model for exact timing relational event models (see [Bianchi et al. (2024)](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-statistics-040722-060248) and [Butts (2008)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9531.2008.00203.x) for more information on these models). Finally, the `simulate_` functions simulate one-mode relational event sequences based upon results of a relational event model. 


## Estimating an (Ordinal) Relational Event Model in `dream`

### Sampling from the Observed Events and Case-Control Sampling

This is a basic example which shows how to sample from the observed events
and employ the case-control sampling technique for large relational event models (see [Butts 2008](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9531.2008.00203.x)) following [Lerner and Lomi (2020)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/network-science/article/reliability-of-relational-event-model-estimates-under-sampling-how-to-fit-a-relational-event-model-to-360-million-dyadic-events/B4286F370CD3A1A4ED30DF5120F04897) and [Vu et al. (2015)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378873315000477). Then based upon the post-processing event sequence, the example computes a set of standard network statistics for two-mode relational event models. Lastly, the examples estimates an ordinal timing relational event model. The event sequence included in this example is based a subset (i.e., the first 100,000 events) of the 2018 Wikipedia article-edit event sequence used in [Lerner and Lomi (2020)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/network-science/article/reliability-of-relational-event-model-estimates-under-sampling-how-to-fit-a-relational-event-model-to-360-million-dyadic-events/B4286F370CD3A1A4ED30DF5120F04897). Across five replications, the average execution time for the example below on a standard MacBook Air was 46.392 seconds. 

```{r processevents}
library(dream)
data("WikiEvent2018.first100k")
WikiEvent2018.first100k$time <- as.numeric(WikiEvent2018.first100k$time)
### Creating the EventSet By Employing Case-Control Sampling With M = 10 and
### Sampling from the Observed Event Sequence with P = 0.01
EventSet <- create_riskset(
  type = "two-mode",
  time = WikiEvent2018.first100k$time, # The Time Variable
  eventID = WikiEvent2018.first100k$eventID, # The Event Sequence Variable
  sender = WikiEvent2018.first100k$user, # The Sender Variable
  receiver = WikiEvent2018.first100k$article, # The Receiver Variable
  p_samplingobserved = 0.10, # The Probability of Selection
  n_controls = 10, # The Number of Controls to Sample from the Full Risk Set
  seed = 9999) # The Seed for Replication

post.processing.riskset <- EventSet[EventSet$sampled == 1,] #only those sampled events! 
```

```{r print, echo=TRUE}
nrow(post.processing.riskset) #the total number of post-processing events
table(post.processing.riskset$observed) # 0 = null events; 1 = observed events
```

Based on the above results, the post-processing event sequence contains 110,000 post-processing events, that is, 10,000 observed events and 10 control events per observed events (i.e., 100,000 null events).
